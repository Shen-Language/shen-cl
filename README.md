# Shen for Common Lisp

[Shen](http://www.shenlanguage.org) for Common Lisp by [Mark Tarver](http://marktarver.com/), with contributions by the [Shen Language Open Source Community](https://github.com/Shen-Language).

This codebase currently supports the following implementations:

  * [GNU CLisp](http://www.clisp.org/)
  * [Clozure Common Lisp](http://ccl.clozure.com/)
  * [Embeddable Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/)
  * [Steel Bank Common Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/)

This port acts as the standard implementation of the Shen language. It is also the fastest known port, running the standard test suite in 4-8 seconds on SBCL, depending on hardware.

Bug reports, fixes and enhancements are welcome. If you intend to port Shen to another variety of Common Lisp, consider doing so as a pull request to this repo.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have recent versions of the Common Lisp implementations you want to work with installed and available as the `Makefile` requires. Installation is different depending on operating system.

Support for Common Lisp implementations varies over different operating systems. By default, only implementations available in binary form are built with the `make all` command. Check the value of the `All` variable in the `Makefile` to see which are supported for your OS and architecture.

Check the project page for any CL implementation to build from source if necessary.

### Linux

CLisp, ECL and SBCL are available through `apt`. Just run `sudo apt install clisp ecl sbcl`.

ECL requires `libffi-dev` to build, which can also be retrieved through `apt`.

There is a [separately available debian package](http://mr.gy/blog/clozure-cl-deb.html) for Clozure. Download and install with `dpkg -i`.

If the version of SBCL available throught `apt` is too old, a sufficiently new version is [available from debian](http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/sbcl/sbcl_1.4.2-1_arm64.deb).

### macOS

CLisp, Clozure, ECL and SBCL can be acquired through Homebrew with `brew install clisp clozure-cl ecl sbcl`.

### FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD

Below is a summary of currently supported implementations per BSD variant. As always, you should check for yourself the availability of these CLs with the package manager of the particular BSD you are running, e.g., `pkg search sbcl` or `pkg_info -Q sbcl`.

|       | FreeBSD            | OpenBSD         | NetBSD                     |
|:------|:-------------------|:----------------|:---------------------------|
| CLisp | N/A                | `pkg_add clisp` | `pkg_add clisp`            |
| CCL   | `pkg install ccl`  | N/A             | N/A                        |
| ECL   | `pkg install ecl`  | `pkg_add ecl`   | `pkg_add ecl`              |
| SBCL  | `pkg install sbcl` | `pkg_add sbcl`  | `pkg_add sbcl` (i386 Only) |

Also, you will need to install GNU make. This repo's `Makefile` is a GNU make makefile and typing `make ...` is likely to invoke the system make (BSD make) and quit on you harshly, complaining about parsing errors. Hence, it is necessary to ensure that the `gmake` package/port is installed, and replace `make ...` in the instructions below with `gmake ...`.

### Windows

CLisp has an installer and a zip package on [SoureForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/clisp/files/clisp/2.49/). You'll have to include `clisp.exe` as well as `libintl-8.dll` and `libreadline6.dll` in on your PATH to ensure the clisp build of shen-cl will run.

Clozure will need to be installed manually:
  * Download the zip from [here](https://ccl.clozure.com/download.html) and extract it under `Program Files`.
  * Add the Clozure directory to your `PATH` or add a script named `ccl.cmd` to somewhere in your `PATH` containing something like:

```batch
@echo off
"C:\Program Files\ccl\wx86cl64.exe" %*
```

ECL needs to be [built from source](https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/static/files/release/). Refer to the [appveyor.yml](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/blob/develop/appveyor.yml) config for build procedure. Requires [Visual Studio 2015+](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) tools. ECL support is spotty on Windows and is not included in `make all` when on Windows.

SBCL has an msi package on its [download page](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html).

The `Makefile` might not be entirely Windows-friendly, so a toolset like [GOW](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow) can fill the gap, or use [MGWIN](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

## Building

The `Makefile` automates all build and test operations.

| Target    | Operation                             |
|:----------|:--------------------------------------|
| `fetch`   | Download and extract Shen sources.    |
| `build-X` | Build executable.                     |
| `test-X`  | Run test suite.                       |
| `X`       | Build and run test suite.             |
| `run-X`   | Start Shen REPL.                      |
| `release` | Creates archive of compiled binaries. |

`X` can be `clisp`, `ccl`, `ecl`, `sbcl` or it can be `all`, which will run the command for all of the preceding.

## Running

An executable is generated for each platform in its platform-specific output directory under `bin/` (e.g. `bin/sbcl/shen.exe`). Per typical naming conventions, it is named `shen.exe` on Windows systems and just `shen` on Unix-based systems.

Startup scripts can be specified on the command line by preceding them with a `-l` flag. If any startup scripts are specified this way, they will be loaded in order and then `(exit 0)` will be called. If none are, the Shen REPL will start as usual. Either way, all command line arguments will be accessible with `(command-line)`.

When starting Shen via `make`, command line arguments can be passed through like this: `make run-sbcl Args="-l bootstrap.shen -flag"`.

## Releases

Archives of pre-built binaries are created using the `make release` command. They will appear under `release/`, named with the operating system and current git tag or short commit hash.

An archive is created for each supported implementation on the current operating system. An executable and/or binaries are included depending on implementation.

For CLisp, CCL and SBCL, the archive contains the `shen[.exe]` executable and a copy of the license.

For ECL, the archive contains the `shen[.exe]` executable, a `shen[.a|.lib]` static library, a `shen[.so|.dylib|.dll]` shared library and a copy of the license.

Each tagged release on the project downloads page should have a set of pre-built archives. Be sure to archive the build of that specific commit, like this:

```shell
make pure
git checkout v1.2.3
make fetch
make sbcl
make release
```
